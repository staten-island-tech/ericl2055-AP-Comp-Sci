    <h2>Life Is Boring</h2>
    <p>
      I happen to live in brooklyn and I dislike waking up at 6 to make it to
      school everyday. I enjoy playing volleyball after school, and I spend most
      of my time doing homework. What I do everyday is normal, similar to most
      other students who attend this school. Wake up early, take a bus to
      school, go home, do homework, sleep, and repeat. I am in no way unique, as
      my life has already been predetermined by school, and there is no way to
      escape except drop out.
